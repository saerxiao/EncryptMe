EncryptMe is an android application, which aims to help users easily save and look up their various account information in a save way. User needs to have a dropbox account to use it. The application creates a txt file, named "account_pwd_note.txt" in the user's dropbox, under directory: Apps/EncryptMe/. The text is encrypted using AES. Users can decrypt, look up information, edit, encrypt and save the file with the application. 

There is a complementary html + javascript utility, which can decrypt the file encrypted by EncryptMe. Vise versa, it can also encrypt the file that can be decrypted by EncryptMe. This utility provides an alternative way to read and edit the encrypted file from PC.
